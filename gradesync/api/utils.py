def handle_errors(func):
    """
    Decorator to handle common exceptions in API endpoints.

    This decorator wraps an API endpoint function to provide standardized error handling. 
    It catches specific exceptions, such as client-side errors (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `AttributeError`) 
    and network-related errors (`RequestException`), and returns appropriate HTTP responses with 
    meaningful error messages. If an unexpected error occurs, it returns a 500 Internal Server Error.

    Parameters:
        func (function): The API endpoint function to be wrapped by the decorator.

    Returns:
        function: A wrapper function that executes the original function with error handling applied.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: If a known error occurs, an appropriate `HTTPException` is raised with
                       status codes:
                       - 400 for client-side errors
                       - 503 for network-related errors
                       - 500 for unexpected errors

    Example:
        >>> @app.get("/example")
        >>> @handle_errors
        >>> async def example_endpoint():
        >>>     # Your endpoint logic here

    Usage:
        Apply this decorator to any FastAPI endpoint to handle errors consistently, without needing
        to duplicate error-handling logic across multiple endpoints.

    Parses course assignment information from a JSON-formatted string and categorizes assignments into

    # TODO: Create an assignment mapping structure that maps one assignment to another assignment for each semester
    # TODO: Example: Lab 4 for Fall 2023 can correspond to Lab 5 in Fall 2024. 
    # TODO: Create a function to input (OldSemester, OldAssignmentID, NewSemester) -> Output new assignmentID. 
    # TODO: The above suggested function is for processing incomplete students.
    # TODO: In Redis, do we want an ID {UNIVERSAL_ID_FOR_ASSIGNMENT: {Fall2023: FALL2023_ID_FOR_ASSIGNMENT, Fall2024: FALL2024_ID_FOR_ASSIGNMENT}}?

    # TODO: Statically configure this assignmentID configuration for Fall 2024 and cache this in Redis
    # TODO: Or statically cache this in a config file to avoid constant API calls to GradeScope
    # TODO: This JSON will be needed to periodically update grades (CRON job) for 1 particular assignment by inputting the assignmentID.

    Each assignment is identified by its "id" and "title" and is categorized accordingly:
    - "lecture_quizzes": Contains lecture quizzes organized by numeric keys.
    - "labs": Contains labs, which may have "conceptual" and "code" subcategories.
    - "discussions": Contains discussions organized by numeric keys.
    - Other categories can be added to the structure as needed.

    Parameters:
    - course_info_response (str): A JSON-formatted string containing assignment details, including 
      unique "id" and "title" fields for each assignment.

    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary with categorized assignments. Each category is structured as a dictionary
      where keys are assignment identifiers (or subcategories), and values are dictionaries 
      containing "title" and "assignment_id".
